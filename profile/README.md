## ℹ️ About TS Calc for Mac

TS Calc was created to bridge the gap between traditional spreadsheets and dedicated engineering software. While Excel and Numbers are great for general data entry, they lack the **structured calculation logic** required in professional fields like engineering, finance, architecture, and research. TS Calc solves this problem by combining the familiar grid-based interface with **powerful formula management, structured models, and reusable calculation workflows**.

With TS Calc, users can define variables, create relationships between them, and build entire calculation "trees" that clearly show dependencies. This approach makes complex calculations easier to audit, modify, and explain — critical in fields where accuracy and traceability are mandatory.  

Unlike basic spreadsheets where errors can hide inside long formula strings, TS Calc emphasizes **clarity and transparency**. Each calculation can be documented, structured, and visually mapped. This ensures not only accuracy but also long-term usability of models across teams and projects.  

TS Calc also supports **conditional logic, iterative models, and advanced mathematical functions**, making it suitable for technical calculations beyond the scope of regular office spreadsheets. It’s particularly valued in **civil and mechanical engineering, construction cost analysis, research labs, and financial modeling**.  

The software integrates seamlessly with macOS, offering a clean interface with customizable views. Results can be exported in multiple formats (PDF, CSV, Excel-compatible) for reporting and collaboration. Thanks to native support for both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs, performance is smooth even for large models.  

Ultimately, TS Calc provides a **structured, professional-grade environment** for creating, maintaining, and sharing calculation projects. It is a tool designed not just for one-off results, but for **repeatable, auditable, and reliable workflows** that professionals can trust.
